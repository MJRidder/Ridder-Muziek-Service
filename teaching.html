                <h3>Teaching style</h3>
                <p>My preferred way of teaching is on an individual basis. This gives me and you the time and space to
                    really get into to the specifics. Not only that, but I also adjust my teaching style and approach to
                    the individual. Each person is different and requires an unique approach.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Preferably I teach at my home in Spierdijk. This is where I have all my documentation availble and I
                    can adjust the approach at any time if it is required. As mentioned I prefer to tailor to the
                    individual and at times this means making adjustments on the go.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Lessons regularly last an hour but also this can be flexible. They can be blocked in for short
                    periods at the time and need to be made by appointment upfront. This means no 40 hour sessions can
                    be booked up front. This is also to remain flexible towards your and my calendar.</p>

                <h3>40 years of experience</h3>
                <p>Over the years I have taught wind instruments to people of all ages and walks of life. My main
                    experience would be teaching medium to low copper insturments (alto horn, baritone, euphonium [high
                    tuba], E-flat bass, B-flat bass, tenor, trumpet, cornet, flugelhorn and french horn and bass
                    trombone).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Much of my experience was gained from teaching in areas where was little to no availability of music
                    schools. This allowed me to work with many diffrent people trying to gain experience for a large
                    variety of projects/orchestra's. Through this I have also taught locally, for example in:
                    Callantsoog, Uitgeest, Tuitjenhorn, De Goorn and Wijdens, just to name a few. I have also worked in a
                    more offical capacity at the Boedijn Music School, catering to the whole of the West-Friesland region.</p>

                <h3>Availability</h3>
                <p>I regularly work with individuals that need incidental "touch ups" on their skills. Therefore to
                    check specifick availability for lessons it is best to reach out through the contact form <a
                        href="contact.html">here</a> or give me a call directly. Locations wise I Preferably teach at
                    home or in one of the music halls available locally.</p>
