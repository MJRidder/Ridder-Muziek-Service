# Bert-Ridder-muziek-service
This is a website created for Bert Ridder Music Service, providing background on his career and the services he provides teaching musical instruments and stand-in conducting.

# Open questions/to do's:
- Fix nav. bar for tablet and desktop, centralise on the line
    + by accident had added a # in the HTML "id" attribute of the .nav bar. Which caused for issues when I tried to fix it in CSS
- Fix hero images and overlaying text - make them compatible on multiple screen sizes
- Fix hero images on mobile (when opening on my own phone they don't show)
- Fix contact form - one size for each screen size, only background should change to fill the screen
- Background of all pages but contact page: find simple pattern? Find stock pictures? single color?
- Add video's to teaching page
- Footer: no social media pages - what would be relevant?
- Fix: Thank you page styling to match the contact page and allow for new requests


Sheryl Suggestions:
- add icon's on the wide/large pages
- add social media links in the footer
- dummy phone number in the contact details
- Add more content/text
- in readme: make sure to highlight that I first aimed at mobile and added media queries for larger screens to give the pages more depth
- bug: not working pictures, add the ./ for assests
