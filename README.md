# Ridder Muziek Service - about the page

Welcome to Ridder Muziek Service! This is the website for Bert Ridder, a conductor 'slash' music teacher 'slash' musician with over 40 years experience in each. Bert is retired officially but as every "old dog of the business" he does not know how to fully quit. Which is why he'd like to be available for incidental projects in conducing, teaching incidental music students or be part of a musical project himself as a musician. 

The goal of this website is to briefly provide context but quickly guide the visitor to reaching out to Bert. Every aspect of the website is set up to guide the user to the contact page. Summarized:

## Business goals
- Get to work on new interesting projects (interim/stand-in conducting)
- Get new students
- Easy to use website with easy contact possibilities (1-2 clicks)
- High focus on mobile functionality due to 'ad-hoc' nature of requests
- (bonus) get work as a (stand-in) musicain
- Become visible online

## Client goals
- Quickly/Easily get in contact with a professional conductor to cover/stand-in for existing conductor or for temporary projects
- Find a brass instrument music teacher in the province of North-Holland

# UX experience
I have tried to keep the user in mind when setting up the pages. Keeping information short and relevant and easily accessable from different platforms. Each page has a quick link (call to action) to "Get in touch" and discuss availability. The website has a simple/clear set up with the aim not to confuse the visitor.

# User stories
In the ideal state the user finds us via Google (or other) search, lands on the home page or even directly on the relevant conductor/teacher/conductor pages. The aim is for them to be able to get to the contact page/details within 1 or two clicks. 

The home page provides sufficient but limited information. With two large buttons for the main uses of this website:
1) Provide a stand-in conductor for an orchestra/ensemble in need.
2) Provide a music teacher for a student in need.

Users will also see a musician page. This is because Bert has requested to have the page added also for being a musician, however the main desire is to gain projects as a stand-in conductor or a music teacher. Visitors of the website will mostly from "the industry" however, which will make it relevant to know as well that Bert is also an active musician for hire as well. 

Each page provides three elements to the visitor:
1) How Bert works (how he conducts/teaches and would this fit their needs?)
2) His experience (providing a strong base for the visitor to base their decision on)
3) What his availability is and for what he is available for (Although many different orchestras/ensembles/students can be helped, it is important not to give false hope to the visitor in case Bert his experience does not match their needs)

# Mobile users
The website was created with "mobile first" mindset. Creating all pages from a 'Samsung Galaxy 8' or 'Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra' basis, before reviewing the websites funcitionality for tables/desktops. With this in mind the formatting has been kept simple, easy to view but sufficient. 

Reasoning for this is simple: Mobile usage in much higher then desktop usage. Avg. page visits per session is less relevant here as the the aim of the website is to get the visitor to a state of 'contact' as soon as possible. Whether if this is via the contact form, phone or email. The below "Get in Touch" button is clear and can be found at the top of every page.

# Wireframes
I used miro.com to create wireframes for this project. During my participation of the July Hackathon it was used by the group which helped me a lot making our project more visible.

Please find my original wireframe below:<br>
![Original wireframe](./assets/images/Readme%20screenshots/Wireframe%20-%20full%20page%20layout.png "Original wireframe")

The original version did contain more (inline) pictures but I decided to step away from this in favor of the pages easy of use. 

In a future state I will also consider a "media page" (seen in the screen shot as the red page) to include audio and video. But more on this later in the future feature section.

# Features

## NAV bar
The navigation bar is adjustable for mobile vs. tables/desktop. Allowing for "hover" visuals and "active" on the larger screens and the "burger format" on Mobile.

Mobile (see burger format)<br>

Tablet (see active format (relevant for all platforms))<br>

Desktop (see the 'hover' underline)<br>
![NAV bar desktop](./assets/images/Readme%20screenshots/NAV-bar-desktop.png "NAV bar desktop")

## Hero image/buttons index page
The main objects that are visible on the homepage are the two buttons referencing the Teacher and Conductor focus of the website. Easy and quick access allowing for fast movement through the website (and a quick call to action)

Homepage "two button" call to action<br>
![Two button call to action](./assets/images/Readme%20screenshots/Mobile-user-step-1-min-cropped.png "Two button call to action")

## "Get in Touch" button (on each page)
Each page contains a quick "get in touch" button to allow for a swift move to contact. This is also the case under the "call to action" on the homepage with two buttons referencing the teaching and conducting page. 

"Get in touch" button to entice visitors to get in contact quickly<br>
![Get in Touch button](./assets/images/Readme%20screenshots/Mobile-user-step-1-min-cropped.png "Get in Touch button")

## hero images containing quick page info
Simple layout and headers that draw the eye allow for showing visitors the main message of the page within the first seconds of visit. Following the mindset of "less is more". 

Quick information headers<br>
![Quick information header](./assets/images/Readme%20screenshots/Page-header-with-brief-information.png "Quick information header")

## similar/easy page layout
Each page currently also containts a simple layout with text separated by dotted lines. Multiple other layouts have been trialled (and might still be used at a later stage) but it often drew the attention away from the main hero image and/or the "get in touch" button. Therefore the current chosen layout is simple and brief. 

## Conducting page link to orchestras for reference
With 35 to 43 years of experience conducting three orchestras across the province of North-Holland, it is important to link their original pages. Even though Bert is no longer actively involved with these orchestras due to his retirements, you can still find audio/video material and articles on these pages that can be reviewed for reference.

## Footer links to socials
Although Bert Ridder does not have his own social media pages at the moment, the social links were added to ensure they could be used towards the future. Especially when linking in the future to audio and video materials online, these will be useful.

Socials in the footer<br>
![Socials in the footer](./assets/images/Readme%20screenshots/Footer-socials.png "Socials in the footer")

## Contact webform (and ease of contact with phone and email)
Essential for the functionality of Bert Ridder his website is the ability to get in contact with him. Therefore the options that are available are clearly indicated. Whether the visitor has a preference for a call (especially for last minute requests), email from their own email provider or utilise the contact webform, they can choose. This is the page where the "Get in Touch" buttons lead to and it has been kept in line with the rest of website, simple and to the point. (concerning the icons, it has been considered to use the 'whatsapp' image rather then the phone icon. Reason for sticking with the phone icon is the on average older population in the classical music industry)

Ease of contact, several options<br>
![Ease of contact, several options](./assets/images/Readme%20screenshots/Contact-form-and-contact-details.png "Ease of contact, several options")

## Thank you page (acknowledgement of form completion)
Similar to the importance of being able to contact Bert for his availability, it is important to acknowledge the visitor for their effort in reaching out. Therefore a thank you page will appear whenever the contact webform is used. Thanking the visitor for reaching out, providing further options of contact and a link back to the homepage.

## Future features

### Audio / video page (summary page)
### Including audio/video on content pages - referencing Bert's work
### Google maps iframe on contact page
### Layout optimizations
### including a third "call to action" button on homepage for "musician"

# Testing
Testing of the various pages has been an ongoing process. Ensuring that mobile comes first has the benefit that overall the pages are tailored for it and will indeed look most streamlined on mobile. It has however ensured that in some cases the page look different on larger screens.

## HTML validator test

## CSS validator test

## (Un)fixed bugs
### #id tag in HTML
For quite some time I could not get the NAV bar work correctly. Whether it was the overall formatting, not being able to get the "burger icon" to contain all the #menu items or to have the menu spread out over the NAV bar on larger screens. It took me a few days to finally realise that I unfortunately made a mistake in my HTML ID element. Adding "< ul #id="menu" >" instead of adding "< ul id="menu" >" without the hashtag. Clearly unconsciously thinking still in the CSS formatting when writing my HTML coding.

### Main two call to action buttons (homepage - teaching/conducting buttons)
As the two main items of this website is linking visitors looking for a music teacher or a stand-in conductor with Bert Ridder, it was important to have something interactive that drew the eye the moment when entering the website. These were the call to action buttons on the homepage. Initially however I was unable to make the full button clickable, ending up with a clickable cover text on a picture, rather then a full picture being clickable.

I requested support from the Tutor function at Code institute to help me review the issue. There it appeared that I had my "< a >" element included in the "< div >" rather then the other way around (having the "< a >" element parent the "< div >"). By switching these I managed make the buttons fully clickable.

# Bert-Ridder-muziek-service
This is a website created for Bert Ridder Music Service, providing background on his career and the services he provides teaching musical instruments and stand-in conducting.

# Open questions/to do's:
- Fix nav. bar for tablet and desktop, centralise on the line
    + by accident had added a # in the HTML "id" attribute of the .nav bar. Which caused for issues when I tried to fix it in CSS
- Fix hero images and overlaying text - make them compatible on multiple screen sizes
- Fix hero images on mobile (when opening on my own phone they don't show)
- Fix contact form - one size for each screen size, only background should change to fill the screen
- Background of all pages but contact page: find simple pattern? Find stock pictures? single color?
- Add video's to teaching page
- Footer: no social media pages - what would be relevant?
- Fix: Thank you page styling to match the contact page and allow for new requests


Sheryl Suggestions:
- add icon's on the wide/large pages
- add social media links in the footer
- dummy phone number in the contact details
- Add more content/text
- in readme: make sure to highlight that I first aimed at mobile and added media queries for larger screens to give the pages more depth
- bug: not working pictures, add the ./ for assests
